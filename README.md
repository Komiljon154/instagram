# InstaClone

InstaClone is a comprehensive, multi-platform social media application inspired by Instagram. This solution demonstrates a wide range of .NET technologies working together, from backend APIs and real-time services to various frontend clients including web, desktop, and mobile.

## Features

- **Core API**: A robust RESTful API for managing users, posts, comments, and likes.
- **Real-time Notifications**: SignalR integration for live updates on new comments and likes.
- **Multiple Frontends**: 
  - Blazor Server App
  - Blazor WebAssembly App
  - ASP.NET MVC Web App
  - WPF Desktop App
  - .NET MAUI Cross-platform App
  - Windows Forms Desktop App
- **Microservices & Background Processing**:
  - gRPC service for high-performance inter-service communication.
  - Worker Service for scheduled background tasks.
  - Azure Functions for serverless, event-driven computations.
- **Clean Architecture**: Solution is structured following Clean Architecture principles (Core, Application, Infrastructure, Presentation).
- **Database**: Utilizes Entity Framework Core with SQL Server.
- **Testing**: Includes a dedicated unit test project for the application logic.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) (or latest stable version)
- [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) (e.g., Express or Developer Edition)
- An IDE like Visual Studio 2022 or VS Code.

### 1. Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd InstaClone
    ```

2.  **Restore dependencies:**
    ```sh
    dotnet restore
    ```

### 2. Database Setup

1.  **Update Connection String:**
    Open the `appsettings.json` file in the `src/InstaClone.Api` project and update the `DefaultConnection` string to point to your local SQL Server instance.
    ```json
    "ConnectionStrings": {
      "DefaultConnection": "Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=InstaCloneDb;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true"
    }
    ```

2.  **Apply EF Core Migrations:**
    Run the following command from the root directory of the solution (`InstaClone/`) to create the database and apply the initial schema.
    ```sh
    dotnet ef database update --project src/InstaClone.Infrastructure --startup-project src/InstaClone.Api
    ```

### 3. Running the Applications

You can run multiple projects simultaneously. The core backend is the Web API.

1.  **Run the Backend API:**
    ```sh
    dotnet run --project src/InstaClone.Api
    ```
    The API will be available at `https://localhost:7123` and `http://localhost:5123`. The Swagger UI can be accessed at `https://localhost:7123/swagger`.

2.  **Run a Frontend Application (example: Blazor Server):**
    Open a new terminal and run:
    ```sh
    dotnet run --project src/InstaClone.BlazorServer
    ```

3.  **Run other applications similarly:**
    - `dotnet run --project src/InstaClone.WebApp.Mvc`
    - `dotnet run --project src/InstaClone.BlazorWasm`
    - `dotnet run --project src/InstaClone.Wpf`
    - `dotnet run --project src/InstaClone.WinForms`
    - `dotnet maui build -t:run -f net8.0-android` (for MAUI)
    - `dotnet run --project src/InstaClone.Worker`
    - `func start` (from within `src/InstaClone.Functions`)

## API Endpoints
